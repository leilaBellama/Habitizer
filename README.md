**Milestone 1 Iteration 1 Velocity:**

For iteration 1, we planned to complete the following user stories:

- US-1: Task List [2 hrs]
- US-2: Check off Task [1 hr]
- US-3: Display Routine's Elapsed Time [3 hrs]
- US-3b: Switch to using Mock Time [2 hrs]
- US-3c: Manually Advance Time [1 hr]
- DS-1: Iteration 1 Testing [1 hr]

We successfully completed US-1, US-2, and US-3, leaving us with a velocity of 6 completed hours / 10 working hours = **0.6**

**Moving into Iteration 2** 

We will consider this velocity to allot the time necessary to complete the tasks required for the completion of Milestone 1, which are as follows:

- US-3b: Switch to using Mock Time [2 hrs]
- US-3c: Manually Advance Time [1 hr]
- DS-1: Iteration 1 Testing [1 hr]
- US-4: Routine Goal Time [2 hrs]
- US-5: End Routine [3 hrs]
- US-6: Track Elapsed Time for each Task [1 hr]
- US-7: Evening Routine [1.5 hrs]
- US-8: Add Task to Routine [1 hr]
- US-9: Rename Task [0.5 hrs]
- DS-2: Iteration 2 Testing [1 hr]

This is a total of 14 hours of work, which suggests we will need to allocate 23 hours! (23 * 0.6 = 14)

Although this sounds like a lot, we believe that thanks to the MVP model we set up in Iteration 1, these stories will be quickly completable and can be done quicker than their estimates. Also, 23 hours split among 5 people is about 4.5 hours per person, which is very doable!

**Milestone 2 Iteration 1 Velocity:**

For iteration 1, we planned to complete 

- DS-1: Fix Timer Automatic Update [2 hrs]
- DS-3: MS1 Testing [2 hrs]
- US-10: Persistence [8 hrs]
- US-1: Add New Routine [5 hrs]
- Iteration Tests [2 hrs]

We were successful in completing DS-1, DS-3, US-1, and iteration tests leaving us with a velocity of 11 completed hours / 16 working hours = **0.6875**

**Moving into Iteration 2**

We need to complete:

- US-10: Persistence [8 hrs]
- DS-2: Routine End Button Inconsistent [1 hrs]
- DS-4: Reset Routine [2 hrs]
- US-2: Edit Routine Name [2 hrs]
- US-5: Update Routine Time Every Minute [1hr]
- US-3: Rearrange Order of Items [2 hrs]
- US-4: Delete Item [1 hrs]
- US-6: Pause Routine [2 hrs]
- US-7: Resume Routine [1 hrs]
- US-8: Display Elapsed Time of Current Task [1 hrs]
- US-9: Display Task Time in Seconds [1 hrs]
- Iteration Tests [2 hrs]

  This is a total of 24 hours of work, which suggests we will need to allocate about 24 / 0.6875 = 35 hours of work! That's about 7 hours per person.
